<h3> The history of the Tatting</h3>
<p> Some believe tatting originated over 200 years ago, often citing shuttles seen in 18th-century paintings of women such as Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,<br> Princess Marie Adelaide of France, and Anne, Countess of Albemarle. A close inspection of those paintings, however, shows that the shuttles in question are too large to be tatting shuttles,<br> and that they are actually knotting shuttles.</p>

<p>The craft is quite popular in Europe. The German word for tatting is Schiffchenarbeit, meaning "the work of the little boat" (i.e. the boat-shaped shuttle.) The Italians call it "occhi," meaning eyes, referring to the rings, which make up the lace. The Turkish say "makouk," which is their word for shuttle. The French call tatting "frivolite" and the Swedish word is similar, "frivolitet" which again describes the character of the work.</p>

<p>There is no documentation of or examples of tatted lace that dates prior to 
  1800. All available evidence shows that tatting originated in the early 19th 
  century.</p>

<p> During the nineteenth century, upper-class women who tatted found the activity 
  an opportunity to show off skill, graceful hands, and beautiful shuttles of 
  ivory, bone, shell, or other precious materials, which might be studded with 
  jewels.</p>
<p> I learned shuttle tatting 35 years ago in Ukraine and almost forgot about 
  this hidden art until 3 years ago I visited Casanova exhibit in Legion of Honor 
  Museum and in the gift-shop saw beautiful artwork brought to us from France. 
  Beautiful jewelry was made by modern artist Lorina Balteanu. I got inspired 
  started tatting again and this year opened my little lace Making ecommerce.
