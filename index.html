<h3> We call it Tatting</h3>
<p> Tatting may have developed from netting and decorative ropework as sailors 
  and fishermen would put together motifs for girlfriends and wives at home.</p>
<p>Decorative ropework employed on ships includes techniques (esp. coxcombing) 
  that show striking similarity with tatting. <br>
  A good description of this can be found in <br>

  -Splices <br>

<h3> The history of the Tatting</h3>
<p> Some believe tatting originated over 200 years ago, often citing shuttles seen in 18th-century paintings of women such as Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,<br> Princess Marie Adelaide of France, and Anne, Countess of Albemarle. A close inspection of those paintings, however, shows that the shuttles in question are too large to be tatting shuttles,<br> and that they are actually knotting shuttles.</p>

<p>There is no documentation of or examples of tatted lace that dates prior to 
  1800. All available evidence shows that tatting originated in the early 19th 
  century.</p>
